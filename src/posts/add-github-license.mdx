Adding a license to your repository helps others understand how they can use, modify, and contribute to your project. By including the **Pay It Forward License (PIF)**, you encourage collaboration and innovation while ensuring clarity about usage rights.

## Why Add a License?

A repository without a license is effectively **proprietary**. Without explicit permission, others cannot legally use, modify, or share your work. Adding a license provides:
- **Clarity**: Defines the permissions and limitations of your project.  
- **Collaboration**: Encourages contributions by removing legal ambiguity.  
- **Growth**: Allows others to build on your work while fostering innovation.

## How to Add the Pay It Forward License (PIF)

### Create a License File

1. In your repository on GitHub, click **Add file** and then **Create new file**.
2. Name the file `LICENSE`.
3. Copy and paste the full text of the **Pay It Forward License (PIF)** into the file.
4. Replace `[Year]` and `[Copyright Holder]` with the appropriate values for your project.
5. Commit the changes to your repository.

### Use the License Template Tool

1. On GitHub, navigate to your repository.  
2. Click the **Add file** drop-down menu and select **Create new file**.  
3. In the filename field, type `LICENSE`.  
4. Click the **Choose a license template** button.  
5. If the Pay It Forward License (PIF) is not listed, manually paste the text from the [PIF License page](/license).  
6. Fill in the placeholder fields (e.g., `[Year]`, `[Copyright Holder]`) and commit your changes.

## Verifying the License

After adding the license, GitHub will automatically recognize it if properly formatted. On your repository's main page, a **License** section will appear, linking to the file.

## Encouraging Contributions

Adding a license is just the first step toward fostering collaboration. You can further encourage contributions by:
- Writing a **README** that explains your projectâ€™s purpose.  
- Including a **CONTRIBUTING.md** file with guidelines for contributing.  
- Adding issues and pull requests to engage potential contributors.

By licensing your repository under the **Pay It Forward License (PIF)**, you join a movement that promotes ethical technology development and innovation.
