### What is the PIF?
The Pay It Forward License (PIF) is a modern open-source license tailored for developers, companies, and communities looking to innovate while giving back. Inspired by the simplicity of the MIT License and the robust protections of Apache 2.0, PIF prioritizes flexibility and collaboration.

### Why It Matters:
The open-source ecosystem thrives when knowledge, resources, and tools are shared freely. The PIF encourages responsible innovation, inspiring users to "pay it forward" by supporting the projects they benefit from and contributing to the broader open-source community.
