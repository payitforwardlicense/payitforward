Open source thrives on collaboration. By contributing to or creating open-source projects, your company can:

- Inspire creativity and experimentation among your teams.

Innovation often happens faster in the open, where ideas are freely shared and improved.

### 2. **Reduce Costs**
Open-source software eliminates the licensing fees associated with proprietary solutions. Companies can:

- Leverage a vast library of free software to accelerate development.  
- Reallocate budget savings to other strategic initiatives.

While open source isn’t “free” in terms of maintenance, the long-term cost savings are significant.
