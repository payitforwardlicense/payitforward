## Steps to Adopt the PIF

### 1. Review the License Terms
Before adopting the PIF, it’s important to review its terms to ensure it aligns with your project’s goals. The full license text can be found [here](/license).

### 2. Add the PIF to Your Repository
To officially adopt the PIF:
- Create a `LICENSE` file in the root of your repository.
- Copy and paste the full PIF text into the file.
- Update your README file to indicate that your project is licensed under the PIF.

**Example for README:**
```markdown
This project is licensed under the [Pay It Forward License (PIF)](/license).
```

### 3. Attribute the PIF
Include proper attribution for the license when distributing your project:
- Retain the `LICENSE` file in the repository.
- Mention the PIF in project documentation or on splash screens, where applicable.

## Informing Contributors

If your project is open to external contributions, it’s essential to communicate the PIF’s purpose to contributors. Include a note in your `CONTRIBUTING.md` file about how the license applies to their contributions.

**Example for CONTRIBUTING.md:**
```markdown
By contributing to this project, you agree to abide by the terms of the Pay It Forward License (PIF), which encourages contributions to the open-source community.
```
